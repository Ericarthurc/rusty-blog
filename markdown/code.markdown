Hey Wildwood Staff, Windows 11 is upon us! This is a pretty weird launch and I want to layout all the info you need to know. I will go over launch dates, how Windows 11 will effect your work at Wildwood, "Should I upgrade?", and then end with some pictures of the biggest changes.

## Launch Dates

From current information gathered, October 20th looks like a solid launch date for Windows 11. This is not 100% confirmed, and could easily change. But the offical version of Windows 11 will launch in a couple months. If you are trying to get access to it now, then you will need to join the <a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">'Windows Insider Program'</a>. But I recommend reading the rest of this post before jumping straight in. ðŸ˜ƒ

## Wildwood Work Flow

So like I said before, Windows 11 is a weird launch and a very unexpected one. Microsoft said Windows 10 would be the last version of Windows ever, but I guess they changed their minds. With that, in the Apple Mac world when they push an update it loves to break support for everything... With this new release of Windows, there actually isn't much difference behind the hood; this seems to be just a user interface change, with some new hardware restrictions (which I will get into in the next section). This is good news as 99% of our current software workflow will just work out-of-the-box!

### Adobe Creative Suite

All the Adobe programs will currently run on the Windows 11 developer builds, so they will most definitely work on release day. Adobe hasn't announced 'offical' support yet, but it will work.

### Propresenter 7

Pro7 does currently run on Windows 11 developer builds perfectly, but again Renewed Vision hasn't announced offical Windows 11 support.

### Printers

All Xerox printers on campus are supported on Windows 11, with all printing features.

### Microsoft Office

All versions of Microsoft Office are supported on Windows 11.

## Should I Upgrade?

So Windows 11 pretty much supports all current software and workflows out of the box. All our software needs here will work just fine on Windows 11. So should I upgrade?

Yep! I support this upgade fully, and encourage you to take the free upgrade when it releases.

### Is there a Catch?

All this sounds too good to be true... a free upgrade that everything currently just works on...Well here is the truth, Windows 11 isn't really an upgrade, it's more of a fresh coat of paint on top of some sneaky Microsoft legal work. With the release of Windows 11, Microsoft is forcing new security measures called 'secure boot' and 'TPM'. I won't break these down a ton, but these forced security measures will be leaving a lot of older computers in the dust. The added requirement of a TPM chip is a real bummer, as many computers dont have these chips, and upgrading to Windows 11 without one will be difficult. Windows 10 will have continued support until 2025, but then it will be highly recommended to move to Windows 11 to continue receiving security updates. So it is highly possible many older desktops and laptops without TPM chips will be stuck on Windows 10 and will loose support in 2025. ðŸ˜” This doesn't mean your device isn't usable, you will just be subject to an operating system without active security updates. It is estimated that 90% of ransomware attacks, on Windows, occur on computers running unsupported versions of older Windows.

This is going to be pretty confusing for many people, as a TPM chip is not really a know thing, but here is a link to a web page that will help you check if your computer has a TPM chip or even how to check your computers BIOS for one to enable: <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-check-if-your-system-has-tpm-chip-for-a-windows-11-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Check if you have a TPM chip</a>.

There is also a tool made by Microsoft that will tell you if your system is ready for Windows 11: <a href="https://aka.ms/GetPCHealthCheckApp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Windows 11 Readiness Check Tool</a>. I guess Microsoft has taken down the app, temporarily, but this link should still be good for the future.

As this is pretty confusing please let me know if you need help checking your computer for a TPM and Windows 11 readiness.

### Church Owned Computers

I just wanted to touch on this really quick. In regards to a church/school owned device that runs Windows, I will be making the upgrade decisions at the appropriate time; this goes for church/school owned Mac devices aswell. Part of my job is keeping up on these devices, and upgrading them when necessary. These memos are more for educating you on your personal devices that you bring to work, which is a lot of you and why I like to send these out. Another part of my job is also securing the network on campus, with so many personal devices coming and going, education of computer safety and best practices is very important in keeping everyone safe.

## Biggest Changes/Features

This next section will contain some info and picutres of what to expect with Windows 11. Windows 11 is more of a new coat of paint than anything, so there is a lot of interface changes, but functionality is pretty much the same as Windows 10.

#### New Windows 11 login screen:

## Conclusion

Windows 11 is coming in a couple months and its more of a theme upgrade than anything. I do recommend this upgrade if your system is setup to handle it. Over the next couple months please let me know and I can help you determine if you system has all hardware needed to upgrade. Thanks for reading! If you have any questions please let me know.
